## API Call Error Handling
If the API call returns a 401 status code, it most likely indicates an issue with the API key. Here's how we handle it:

- In `weatherapp.js`, we send an API request to the Open Weather Map API using the `axios` library. We pass the API key in the request URL.
- If the API key is incorrect or has an issue, Open Weather Map returns a 401 status code to indicate an authentication problem.
- To fix this issue, please ensure that you have set your API key correctly in the `.env` file. Double-check the API key's accuracy and that it's in the correct format.

## Design Choices and Styling
Our design choices for the weather app aim to provide a simple and user-friendly interface. We've used CSS to style the elements:

- **Background**: The app has a clean white background for easy readability and a calm appearance.

- **Weather Information Box**: The weather information is displayed in a visually appealing box with a light gray background. This box is created using CSS styles like `background-color`, `padding`, and `border-radius`.

- **Error Messages**: Error messages are displayed in red to ensure they stand out and are easily identifiable. We use the CSS `color` property to set the text color to red.

- **Font**: We chose Arial as the font for the text elements. Arial is a widely recognized and readable font, making the information clear and easy to read.

- **Input Field and Button**: The input field for entering the city name and the "Get Weather" button are styled for a consistent and neat appearance.

These design choices create a straightforward and visually pleasing user interface that focuses on presenting weather information clearly.

Feel free to customize the design further by modifying the CSS styles in the `style.css` file to match your preferences or branding.
